# Google-Data-Capstone-Project
Capstone project for final project.  
Data analysis for a bike-share company in order to help them attract more riders. 

In the src folder the file 'main_script.ipynb' is a deliverable with all the steps carried out for the analysis.

The analysis can be visualized in the following Tableau link

The recommendations for Stakeholders are the following:

1. Offer annual subscription plan for dockeable type riders. These are solely casual users yet they represent over 220K yearly trips.
2. Offer benefits for new annual members in the downtown area of Chicago. A huge porcetange of stations with only one type of user category are located in the downtown area. There are 7 stations in the downtown area that represent more than 450K yearly rides of the casual user category.
3. Offer benefits for new annual members who use electrical bikes. This could improve Cyclistic's opinion to the public and increase revenue as well, since electrical rides represent 1.13 Million of yearly casual users.

It would be useful in the future to add an 'age category' column to the trips, to further analyze how riders behave on holidays, weekends and summer breaks.
